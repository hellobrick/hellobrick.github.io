      <description>This year - as gift for the father&amp;rsquo;s day - I&amp;rsquo;ve received the beautiful Central Perk ~ LEGO 21319 set  .
Being a fan of the TV serie, the gift was twice welcome, and I was looking forward very much to spend a couple of hours on it&amp;hellip; but if I&amp;rsquo;ve been told that the opportunity to build it, would have been given me by the world-level spread of covid-19, I would have gladly declined it.</description>

      <description>Sunday, March 15. Spring is sprung early this year; we can feel the sun is warm outside our windows, and hear chirping of birds. Perfect weather to stay at home, and play LEGO.
Oh, no&amp;hellip; I am not kidding.
Ok, I admit, we like LEGO, and everything, but in similar condition, usually playing with LEGO would be the latest thing we would do. Anyway, this weekend is different, cause there&amp;rsquo;s coronavirus emergence in our country, and our government has recommended to avoid going out if not necessary.</description>
