      <description>In this period, we - as many of you - are passing almost 100% of our time at home.
One positive aspect of this &amp;ldquo;always staying at home&amp;rdquo;, is that we were able to accomplish lot of things we had postponed for long time, such as our family LEGO portrait.
We bought the minifigs and the picture frame months ago, but never assembled it, till very recently.
We bought the picture frame from IKEA, RIBBA.</description>

      <description>Sunday, March 15. Spring is sprung early this year; we can feel the sun is warm outside our windows, and hear chirping of birds. Perfect weather to stay at home, and play LEGO.
Oh, no&amp;hellip; I am not kidding.
Ok, I admit, we like LEGO, and everything, but in similar condition, usually playing with LEGO would be the latest thing we would do. Anyway, this weekend is different, cause there&amp;rsquo;s coronavirus emergence in our country, and our government has recommended to avoid going out if not necessary.</description>
