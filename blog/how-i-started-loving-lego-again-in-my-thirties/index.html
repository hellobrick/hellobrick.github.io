    <div class="post-body"><p>As much as I loved LEGOs during my childhood - I have to admit - I stopped caring about them as soon as I started growing up&hellip; and never thought much about them until very recently.</p>
<p>I suspect this is common to many AFOL.</p>
<p>Six years ago, I became father of the most wonderful little girl&hellip; No, that&rsquo;s not when I re-discovered my passion for LEGOs; at the time, as you might guess, we haven&rsquo;t much free time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved spending time with my daughter, and she likes playing with me, too. When she was still a little girl, her favorite games were role-play games. So, for long time, everyday after work, I took off my programmer hat and put on a doctorâ€™s hat, or a clerkâ€™s hat, or a little babyâ€™s hat.</p>
<p>Time really flew, fast forward to today, I&rsquo;m father of the most wonderful 6yo little girl ðŸ˜€ - who still loves role-play game more than every other toy she got during these years&hellip; LEGOs are the only toys which can stand comparison.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s perhaps not much surprising; LEGO has an incredibly wide offering of products, loved all around the world by children, and adults. With a such rich variety of offerings, you might be surprised to know, that, what cought our attention were probably the simplest of all their products: the creativity box.</p>
<p>We started with the <a class="affiliate-link" href="https://amzn.to/2x6UM0b" title="Orange Creativity Box ~ LEGO Classic 10709">

</a>
, and in less than a week we had already ordered <a class="affiliate-link" href="https://amzn.to/2xaVutk" title="Blue">

</a>
, <a class="affiliate-link" href="https://amzn.to/3b09app" title="Red">

</a>
, and <a class="affiliate-link" href="https://amzn.to/2UWnGcb" title="Green">

</a>
.</p>
<p>My daughter, almost immediately, started to mix the colors, creating her own fantastic shapes. I was surprised by the variety of new pieces at our disposal, but still could feel the same feelings of when I was child, but with greater joy this time, because I was playing with my daughter. In no time we both were hooked.</p>
