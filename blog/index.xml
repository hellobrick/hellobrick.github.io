      <description>Sunday, March 15. Spring is sprung early this year; we can feel the sun is warm outside our windows, and hear chirping of birds. Perfect weather to stay at home, and play LEGO.
Oh, no&amp;hellip; I am not kidding.
Ok, I admit, we like LEGO, and everything, but in similar condition, usually playing with LEGO would be the latest thing we would do. Anyway, this weekend is different, cause there&amp;rsquo;s coronavirus emergence in our country, and our government has recommended to avoid going out if not necessary.</description>
